Fanfic wishes:

Consolidate everything by RavensDagger into one point "Something by RavensDagger", if you've read one you've read all.
Then add "Something by Alivaril", "Something by Zerrer" and "Something by Saphroneth". (If RavensDagger gets an entry, Saph should too. If you want a reference, Harry Is A Dragon And That's Okay is complete and excellent.)
Add Xander Quest and Puella Magi Adfligo Systema. Add Wizard Space Program, Into That Vast And Unrelenting Darkness, Battle Action Harem Highschool Side Character Quest (BAHHSCQ, I literally know people who that quest turned transhuman) and Usagi Quest.
The HPMOR sequels maybe? At least Significant Digits should be on the list.
Seventh Horcrux is the funniest fanfic I know, first place no qualification.
I would make an argument for Vox Vitae but it's a bit young.
Add Finale of the Ultimate Meta Mega Crossover!!
Time Braid is a classic!
Projection Quest should be on there because it basically started a genre.
Commander, for the same reason (it started the PASI Multicross wave).
The Games We Play did for Gamer fics what DK Ami did for Dungeon Core.
